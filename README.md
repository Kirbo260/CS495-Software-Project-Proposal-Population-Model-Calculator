# CS495-Software-Project-Proposal-Population-Model-Calculator

Population Model Calculator
A web‑based interactive tool for performing key calculations related to population models. This project is being developed as a CS495 Software Engineering Capstone under the guidance of Dr. Suzanne Keilson, Associate Professor at Loyola University Maryland.
The tool is designed to support students, instructors, and researchers who work with population dynamics by providing an accessible, user‑friendly, and feature‑rich platform for modeling, visualizing, and comparing population behaviors.
